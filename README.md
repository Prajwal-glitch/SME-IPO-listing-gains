🧩 Problem Description

SME IPOs in India have become increasingly popular due to their potential for high listing gains.
However, investors struggle with:

Lack of centralized, clean historical SME IPO data

Difficulty quantifying the impact of fundamentals, GMP, subscription, and anchor activity

Very high volatility and unpredictability in SME listings

👉 Goal of this project:
Build an ML model that predicts the expected listing price and listing gain %, allowing investors to make more informed decisions on whether to apply to an IPO purely for listing gains.

The project focuses on:

Collecting SME IPO data from multiple public sources

Preprocessing and feature engineering

Model training (Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

Feature importance analysis

Final model selection (Linear Regression family performed best)
